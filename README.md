# WhoWantsToBeRich
What is sought in this game is to pre-build a series of questions with 4 answer options and one of them valid,
plus a category associated with the same difficulty level. Each question must be categorized and there must be at least 5 questions per category
where for each round a question must be drawn from that category randomly, there must be 5 rounds throughout the game,
each round awards prizes (points or money) when the player is correct.

The prize rush is within the competition but if the player tries to
quit the game he can withdraw before answering the question, if the player
loses instead he would leave the game without the rush he would take at that time.
